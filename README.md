elgg-notify
===========

Desktop notification daemon for elgg activity

If you collaborate in an elgg community, and use Linux in your desktop, this little script will show notifications whenever elgg posts (aka "river") are updated.

Just place the script in /usr/local/bin, and run it when your desktop session (Gnome?) starts.

Do not forget to copy the provided configuration file to your home directory, renaming it as .elgg-notify.conf

Edit this configuration parameters to fit your installation.
