elgg-notify
===========

Desktop notification daemon for elgg activity

If you collaborate in an elgg community (and you use Linux in your desktop) this little script will show notifications whenever elgg posts (aka "river") are updated.

INSTALLATION

* You will need Python (tested with 2.7), and ConfigObj library (python-configobj package)
* Copy the provided configuration file to your home directory, renaming it as .elgg-notify.conf
* Edit configuration parameters to fit your elgg installation.
* Place the script (elgg-notify) in /usr/local/bin and give it execution permission
* Launch it when your desktop session (Gnome?) starts
